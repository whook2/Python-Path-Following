# Python: Path Following
This program is a continuation of the first dynamic movement program. Using the same seek function, this program implements a path following behavior, given the coordinates for a certain path. The movement algorithms are sourced from pseudocode from the textbook "Artificial Intelligence for Games, 3rd Edition" by Millington
